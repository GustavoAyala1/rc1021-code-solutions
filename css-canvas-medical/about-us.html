              Why did we enter this crowded field? Because medical records have
              fallen dramatically short of their promise to improve the quality
              and efficiency of health care. Clinicians spend far too long at
              their computers. Workflows are overly restrictive. Valuable
              medical data is left unstructured.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are honored, and humbled, when a practice chooses us as their
              technology partner. Medicine is a delicate craft that mixes art
              and science - technology can help or hinder this craft. Working
              with clinicians across the country, we think we have begun to
              build somethiing that helps

            <p>
              Andrew founded Canvas in 2015 after years of seeing his wife Anna
              - a family nurse practitioner - sacrifice family time in the
              evenings to "finish" charting. It never ended.
            </p>
            <p>
              Andrew knew that the answer wasn't to go out and do it alone. he
              started to fill the gaps in his experience. Seven practicing
              clinicians formed the clinical advisory board - rather than leave
              practice to work full-time with Canvas, they used the reviewed
              prodcut changes in their practices. Our Medical director, Dr.
              Zimmerman, joined when he saw the potential of Canvas to help
              independent practices like his practice, Temescal Creek Medicine
              in Oakland, CA. Julian joined Canvas after working at Medicare and
              seeing the failures of current technology to keep up with
              increasing regulatory demands without burdening clinicians. Joe
              and a word class group of software developers joined to accelerate
              our ability to listen to clinician feedback and constantly improve
              the product.
            </p>
            <p>
              With Canvas, we created a fundamentally different way of charting
              that completely eleminates the need for menus and pop-ups. The
              name of teh company describes the charting experience - it feels
              like a blank canvas where you can tell the patient's story and
              seamlessly complete notes, orders, and chart review on a single,
              unified screen. With seamlessly integrated population health,
              billing, and practice management. Canvas is a reimagined platform
              for the modern primary care practice.
