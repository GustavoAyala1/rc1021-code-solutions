            <h3><span>1.</span> Making the Decision To Switch</h3>
            <p>
              You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have
              determined that we far outperform other verndors and offer an
              unmatched return on investment. Our goal is to give you as much
              information as possible to make this determination one way or the
              other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas
              application for you to get a feel for teh platform as well as
              references to current customers to talk about their experience.

              The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your
              current data, which we have executed successfully with both
              remotely hosted and on-premise EMR databases. Then our work begins
              to import into Canvas. Patient demographics and infromation like
              medications, problems, and allergies is relatively
              straightforward. While importing clinical notes and documents is
              more challengin, our team has been able to do this at a high level
              of fidelity with a wide vaiety of EMRs.
