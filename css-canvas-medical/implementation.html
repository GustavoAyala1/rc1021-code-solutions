            <h3><span>1.</span> Making the Decision To Switch</h3>
            <p>
              You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have
              determined that we far outperform other verndors and offer an
              unmatched return on investment. Our goal is to give you as much
              information as possible to make this determination one way or the
              other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas
              application for you to get a feel for teh platform as well as
              references to current customers to talk about their experience.
            </p>
            <h3><span>2.</span> Interfaces and Community Integration</h3>
            <p>
              The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your
              current data, which we have executed successfully with both
              remotely hosted and on-premise EMR databases. Then our work begins
              to import into Canvas. Patient demographics and infromation like
              medications, problems, and allergies is relatively
              straightforward. While importing clinical notes and documents is
              more challengin, our team has been able to do this at a high level
              of fidelity with a wide vaiety of EMRs.

            <h3><span>4.</span> Training and Site Visit</h3>
            <p>
              We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including
              clinical content, charge schedules, and much more. Role-based
              trainings will be done a few weeks prior to go-live to familiarize
              relevant team members with clinical, practice management, and
              biliing workflows. Either before or during go-live, one of our
              team can visit your practice to work side-by-side with you on
              implementation and training.
            </p>
            <h3><span>5.</span> Go-Live and Tuning</h3>
            <p>
              Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your
              practice. We will be with you, either in-person or remotely
              depending on your preference, to make sure everything goes
              smoothly. There is always fine tuing to do once you have a handful
              of encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing clinical
              microtemplates, setting up new automations, modifying practice
              management settings, and more. We are here to help with it all.
            </p>
            <h3><span>6.</span> Sustained Performance</h3>
            <p>
              All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken
              promises and provide support over the long term. Our Performance
              Warranty means that if we are not meeting expectations, you can
              terminate the agreement and receive all payments back. (We do not
              expect this to happen). For our Standard plans, we also offer a
              MIPS guarantee: if you receive a negative adjustment, we will
              cover it. And for everyone, we provide unlimited 24/7 support at
              no charge. We expect this to be a long, productive partnership for
              us both.
