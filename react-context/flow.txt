User Can Sign Up.
  The client enters a username
    if the username isnt already being used then it allows it
      and sends you to the sign in page
      the username is added to the database and the password is hashed and saved
User can sign in.
    On the sign in page the user enters their username and password
    the DB is queried to see if that username exists and if it does then
    the password is verified to see if it matches the hashed password
    if it does a token is then given to the user so he can stay logged i
User can stay signed in (even if they refresh the page).
  if the user refreshes after logging in the token is checked to see if its good
  if it isnt then the user has to log in again
  if it is then the user stays logged in
User can sign out.
  the token is removed and the use is taken back to the sign in page
